              "xxbos math & science , applied learning applied sciences , other ipad for istudents ! my students are starting off their academic careers at turner / bartels ! turner / bartels is a stem school that leads many opportunities to use technology to enhance the learning of the child . my students have the opportunity to reach past all boundaries with technology and different learning ! my students are from all different cultural backgrounds and have a multitude of experiences . a majority of my students come from he new tampa area and have walked many paths . please help them reach the stars ! thank you ! having technology at the finger tips of each of my students allows them to understand and investigate more than what is brought into the classroom . my students will be researching cultures , animals , and a multitude of different things . technology enhances children 's learning by giving them boundless opportunities . we are also able to use programs that differentiate learning to meet the needs of all of my students . i am hoping through this piece of technology i am able to give my students more opportunities in learning and in their skills for the future . thank you for your donations and go tigers ! na na my students need to be prepared for 21st century jobs and the evolutionary future . with an ipad , my students are able to do research , see places , and explore bounds !,xxbos literacy & language literacy , literature & writing tech tools for teaching and learning my students are creative , intelligent , and fun ! our school serves a historic neighborhood in dc that is currently a mix of middle class families and families that struggle financially . we are a title i school . many of our students fight daily battles with poverty , emotional issues , and family transitions . r n r neven with fighting many daily battles , our students bring all the energy , excitement , and curiosity to learning that you would expect . they are dedicated students with a thirst for knowledge . please help me maximize this critical third grade year for my students benefit ! my students each have a reading journal where they record notes and other written work . i often find myself wanting to demonstrate how i would write notes in the journal . or , how to divide a page to include all components of an answer . i 'm unable to show them the process i 'm taking . also , it is difficult for students to share their writing with the class immediately . r n r nthe document camera would enhance our learning experience on a daily basis . it will allow me to demonstrate my process in writing answers to questions and writing notes . in the long run , demonstrating these processes will help students to complete notes and text - dependent answers independently . na na my students need a tool that helps them share written work with the class . the document camera will project paper documents onto our smart board for easy viewing .,xxbos literacy & language literacy love books i have 20 curious little people that just started first grade . they love school . everything right now is new and exciting . they have varied reading abilities that need to be met . i want first grade to be a memorable year . a year in which they learned many new concepts and increased their love of learning . most of the children are on free and reduced lunch . i hope utilizing this project in my class will encourage my students to read more in school and at home . my students just started first grade and are very excited about learning to read . i want to set up a listening station that can be used daily . i have found in the past , books with cassette tapes get broken easily . i would like to get books with cds because they are easier for little hands to use and last a long time . i know my students will enjoy this center and listen to the stories over and over again . i hope this station will spark an interest in going to the public library to get books to read at home . r n r nlistening to an audio book will instill an enjoyment of reading , help my children learn new vocabulary , and model fluency . r n r n na na my students need audio books to be placed in our listening center .,xxbos math & science mathematics make learning fun in 3rd grade ! my students are the sweetest group of 3rd graders . my students are thoughtful , inquisitive , and so eager to learn . they love to do steam projects and use technology . r n r n the art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery . mark van doren r nmy students love to create , explore and discover new ways to solve problems and learn . our classroom is always so full of conversation , and energy . they love to collaborate and share ideas while working together . we are moving through 3rd grade ! r n my third grade students are very energetic and bubbly students who are eager to learn using many different learning styles . we do our best to incorporate movement throughout the school day but sometimes it is necessary to sit and listen to instruction . this can be sometimes be hard for some students . so my project includes alternatives . although we have a few alternative seats , we do not have near enough for a class of 20 . studies show that alternative seating can be a good option for students that are always moving . we have a flower table that will be our vip table , and we need flexible seating and several supplies for that table as well . na na my students need these items to help us learn in a creative way while using our imagination . flexible seating helps my students learn in a more comfortable way .,xxbos math & science environmental science a distraction free zone i work in a large school with a diverse group of students with large classroom sizes . these students work very hard in their academics and are working on 21st - century skills to help them be successful later in life . due to the large class sizes , we are packed in the room where it is sometimes difficult to focus . these students are new to middle school and are learning self - control still . with such large class sizes we are sitting 3 sometimes 4 to table which makes testing a challenge . this year the state is requiring us to have partitions for tables that seat more the 2 , so in an effort to save our school the money i am posting this project ! r n with state testing approaching quickly we are trying to better prepare our students for what is to come . with the large classroom sizes at our school it is hard for students to remained focused during the long tests . in an effort to help fix this problem i am trying to help my school get enough materials to xxunk students during testing so that they are able to focus and finish their test to the best of their ability . the state has requested that we have partitions and while this is aggravating to find out so close to testing , i feel the students will largely benefit from have less distractions around them . na na my students need to have as little distraction as possible when testing .\n",
